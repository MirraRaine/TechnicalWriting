# Capstone Project: Technical Writing - Microsoft Graph Call Records API

Welcome to my Capstone Project designed to showcase my technical writing skills, certified by [Technical Writer HQ](https://technicalwriterhq.com/). Although I am a software engineer, this project serves as evidence of my proficiency in creating clear, concise, and comprehensive technical documentation.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my capability to produce various types of technical documents. The capstone project includes seven different types of documentation and covers various aspects of the Microsoft Graph Call Records API.
